LSH (Kenzyy’s Little SHell) is a lightweight Unix shell written in C.
It is designed purely for learning: process control, fork(), execvp(), parsing, and implementing simple built-ins.

This project follows the classic structure of a minimal POSIX shell and is ideal for anyone studying systems programming or OS concepts.
